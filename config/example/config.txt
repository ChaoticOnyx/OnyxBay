## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game. In this case it will read "tgstation: station_name" where station_name is the randomly generated name of the station for the round. Remove the # infront of SERVERNAME and replace 'tgstation' with the name of your choice
# SERVERNAME spacestation13

## Subserver name: Only used as part of game's window title name. Leave commented and it won't appear.
# SUBSERVER_NAME chaotic

## Server id. This is used, when you have more than one server connected to single DB.
## NOTE! You should migrate your DB to schema with server_id applied to each ban record

## As of byond 512, due to how broken preloading is, preload_rsc MUST be set to 1 at compile time if resource URLs are *not* in use,
## BUT you still want resource preloading enabled (from the server itself).
## If using resource URLs, it should be set to 0 and changed to a URL at runtime (see client_procs.dm for procs that do this automatically).

## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means
