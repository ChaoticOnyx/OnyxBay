## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game. In this case it will read "tgstation: station_name" where station_name is the randomly generated name of the station for the round. Remove the # infront of SERVERNAME and replace 'tgstation' with the name of your choice
# SERVERNAME spacestation13

## Subserver name: Only used as part of game's window title name. Leave commented and it won't appear.
# SUBSERVER_NAME chaotic

## Server id. This is used, when you have more than one server connected to single DB.
## NOTE! You should migrate your DB to schema with server_id applied to each ban record

## As of byond 512, due to how broken preloading is, preload_rsc MUST be set to 1 at compile time if resource URLs are *not* in use,
## BUT you still want resource preloading enabled (from the server itself).
## If using resource URLs, it should be set to 0 and changed to a URL at runtime (see client_procs.dm for procs that do this automatically).

## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.

## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied. Higher values result into lower move speed.
