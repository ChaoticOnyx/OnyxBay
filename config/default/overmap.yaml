        The rally point for all ships returning from patrols, deliveries, and shakedowns.
        Here Whiterapids personnel are stripped of their gear,
        turn in contraband, and allowed to take leave.

        Lalande has always held hypergates for Federation travel.
        From the Delphic Expanse to the Rosetta Cluster
        this system is always seeing ships come and go to aid in the war effort
        and provide corporate and civilian travel alike.

        The heart and home of humanity, the centerfold of the technological singularity.
        Even after the disaster, Earth stands as a veritable stronghold, sprawling cityscape, and absolute paradise.
        Billions of people live here, the beating heart of the Federation houses wormgates, hypergates,
        and hyperlanes to the rest of the Federation but you have no business there right now.
