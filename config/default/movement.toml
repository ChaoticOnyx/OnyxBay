## We suggest editing these variabled in-game to find a good speed for your server.
## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.
## Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration".
## These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied. Higher values result into lower move speed.
run_speed = 3

walk_speed = 7

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
